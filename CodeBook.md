This assignments rquires creation of a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

STEPS:

1. Download and extract the original dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Run run_analysis.R script in RStudio

3. run_analysis.R will:

3.a merged the training and testing dataset 
3.b out of the dataset from 3a, it then produces a subset of data that only contain variables pertaining to "mean" or "standard deviation"

For the record, these are the variables: 
"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
"tBodyAcc-std()-X"
"tBodyAcc-std()-Y"
"tBodyAcc-std()-Z"
"tGravityAcc-mean()-X"
"tGravityAcc-mean()-Y"
"tGravityAcc-mean()-Z"
"tGravityAcc-std()-X"
"tGravityAcc-std()-Y"
"tGravityAcc-std()-Z"
"tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X"
"tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y"
"tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z"
"tBodyAccJerk-std()-X"
"tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y"
"tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z"
"tBodyGyro-mean()-X"
"tBodyGyro-mean()-Y"
"tBodyGyro-mean()-Z"
"tBodyGyro-std()-X"
"tBodyGyro-std()-Y"
"tBodyGyro-std()-Z"
"tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X"
"tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y"
"tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z"
"tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X"
"tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y"
"tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z"

"tBodyAccJerkMag-std()"
"tBodyGyroMag-mean()"
"tBodyGyroMag-std()"
"tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()"
"tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"
"fBodyAcc-mean()-X"
"fBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
"fBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
"fBodyAcc-std()-X"
"fBodyAcc-std()-Y"
"fBodyAcc-std()-Z"
"fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X"
"fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y"
"fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z"
"fBodyAccJerk-std()-X"
"fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y"
"fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z"
"fBodyGyro-mean()-X"
"fBodyGyro-mean()-Y"
"fBodyGyro-mean()-Z"
"fBodyGyro-std()-X"
"fBodyGyro-std()-Y"
"fBodyGyro-std()-Z"
"fBodyAccMag-mean()"
"fBodyAccMag-std()"
"fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()"
"fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()"
"fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()"
"fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()"
"fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()"
"fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"

2.c For each subject and each activity, calculates the mean of each subsetting measure
